# Ode to an Icon

The Honourable Patrick FitzGerald, retired Superior Court Judge "orated" a poem that he had just coined--it wasn't on paper, but by memory. He is 94 years old and a good friend, smart fella, and fun to be around. Here it is:

ODE TO AN ICON: by Pat FitzGerald

Oh to be Roberta Bondar<br />
To walk in space away up yonder<br />
To see our planet from afar<br />
As if from some celestial star<br />
And then to leave us much to ponder.

- Marg Simpson
