During the building of the Open Hearth furnaces for the new steel mill around 1900 a village in the West End on what is now Essar property was established.

It was called Tagona Village. The first construction workers lived there in tents. Mostly Brick Layers from all points including Chicago and Italy. No doubt the forerunners of our large Italian populace in this city.
