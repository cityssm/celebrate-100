# Era of Streetcars

This is back in the mid 1930's during the era of streetcars - I lived on Second Street which was at that time inside the Steel Plant. In order to reach our homes you went over what was called the 'High Line' where you could look down through the cracks on the boards to see trains below. I remember when the car barn (streetcar) caught on fire and the men on our street were called out to help put out the blaze.

Back during this time, I remember the houses were very nice. There were black shingles on the roofs of houses and everyone had lovely front and back yards. Our area was also called Tagona, we had great neighbours, everyone did.

There was a gas station in the area of where the street car stopped, a confectionery store, and a two or three story red brick building which I think held the offices. The houses were sold later on and relocated. Today people can't believe we lived there but we sure did.
