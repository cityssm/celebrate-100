# Return to Sault Ste. Marie

I was born in Sault Ste. Marie in 1966, left when I was 1 year old to Portugal, then returned to Toronto in 1984. This year was the perfect time to visit.

I rode my bike there August 28, (took me 8 hours), and then rode 5 to see my first house, where I was baptized, the old hospital and the outskirts; nice City.

On Wednesday, when I left I was a little choked up; I'll go again.

Can't believe I was there almost half of century ago!!
