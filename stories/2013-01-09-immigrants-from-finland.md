Year 1901-02 eight young men immigrated to Saults Ste. Marie ON / MI from a small Parkano village, Finland. My grandfather Alexander ALAKIRJANEN was one of them, but he came back to Finland later and built a farm and had 10 children. Grandfather's brother Oscar b1874 and Victor b 1876 ALAKIRJANEN and cousins Manasse b1874, Nestor b1877, Hiskias b1879 and Viktor b 1883 YLIKIRJANEN moved to Soo. Have you heard about them? They wrote maybe their familyname briefly KIRJANEN.

Happy 100 anniversary. Best regards!
